## Introduction

In modern times, a [[low-level programming language]] is any language in which you (the developer) handle memory management. Any language where that memory management or garbage collection is done for you, which is now most languages, is considered [[high-level programming language|high level]].

>***Definition:** A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little to no abstraction from a computer's [[instruction set architecture]].*

According to the classical definition, only languages like [Machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) and [[Assembly language]] would be considered [[low-level programming language|low-level]].  Other languages that interact closely with the hardware, like [[low-level programming language|low-level programming languages]], called [[hardware description language|hardware description languages]] ([[Verilog]], [[System Verilog]], [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL)) can be used in a similar fashion, but is meant to design and control digital circuits like [[FPGA|FPGAs]].

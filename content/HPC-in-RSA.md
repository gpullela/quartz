## HPC Optimization in RSA Encryption  
This project was an implementation built on the research I did on the [[Math_Behind_RSA_Encryption.pdf|Mathematics Behind RSA Encryption]].  I worked with a fellow undergraduate, under the mentorship of a Ph.D. student, learning [[C]] and the basics of the [[OpenMP]] API which we in turn used to create a [[HPC]] Optimized version of the [[RSA]] [[Encryption]]/[[Decryption]] algorithms.

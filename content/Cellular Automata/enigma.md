## Introduction

An [[enigma|Enigma machine]] is a [[cipher]] device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century, in order to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communications.  
The Enigma machine was invented by German engineer [Arthur Scherbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Scherbius) at the end of World War I.  It was improved Nazi Germany and used as a form of [[Encryption|encryption]] and [[Decryption|decryption]], but was later exploited by the Allied forces during World War II, notably with the help of [[alan-turing|Alan Turing]].

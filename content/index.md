You will find that many of the projects have linked notes - that is the beauty of a digital garden (and using Markdown files)!  My notes are written using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and built using [jackyzha0/quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), which allows me to display this amazing vault as a website statically using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a single Github Workflow.

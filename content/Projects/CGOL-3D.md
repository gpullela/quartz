title: Conway's Game of Life in 3D ðŸ‘¾
date: 2023-11-07

## Introduction  

This project is based on [[CGOL|Conway's Game of Life]].  For my initial implementation, I leveraged my knowledge [[c|C Programming]], [[HPC|High Performance Computing]], and [[OpenMP|the OpenMP library]] in order to develop a simple 3D adjusted simulation of the [[CGOL|Game of Life]].  As of now, the project only works on [[CPU|CPUs]].    

I am currently working on building an implementation of this project using [[Python]] and [[JAX]], that runs using [[GPU|GPUs]].

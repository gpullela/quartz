## *An investigation of the effect of optical density on the intensity of different wavelengths of visible light* 

>[!abstract]
>This paper explores a topic, under Wave Phenomenon, called polarization to answer the following research question: ***“What is the relationship between optical density of a polarizer and the intensity of different wavelengths of light?”*** 
>
>A wave of light is said to be polarized when if the electric field off the wave oscillates on the same field. The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the effect of partial polarization on different wavelengths of light, and if possible, determine a general relationship between the intensity of light and its wavelength at a given angle of polarization. To determine this relationship, an experiment was designed, to test for a general trend in the visible light spectra, using red, green, and violet light. Using the raw data from the experiment, a relationship will be derived, and a general trend will be integrated. 
>
>The effect of polarization on real world applications is also studied, including the effect of polarization due to water, which affects the growth of aquatic plants, which are a crucial part of the aquatic ecosystem. There are many practical application that concern this topic, which is why it is the topic in study. 
>
>The effect of polarization of light can be applied to the concept of UV polarization. This can be use to prevent UV from harming our bodies. 
>
>The topics of polarization and light intensity are explored, and the applications of the experiment are discussed.

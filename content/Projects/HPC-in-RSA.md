title: HPC Optimization in RSA Encryption
date: 2023-11-07

## Introduction  

This project was an implementation built on the research done for the paper I wrote, *The Mathematics behind RSA Public Key Encryption and its applications*.  I worked with a fellow undergraduate, under the mentorship of a Ph.D. student, learning [[c|C Programming]] and the basics of the [[OpenMP]] API which we in turn used to create a [[HPC]] Optimized version of the [[RSA]] [[Encryption]]/[[Decryption]] algorithms.
